# Employed Technologies
- Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. According to its authors, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.
- HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts: It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that allows more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. This set is sometimes called HTML5 & friends and often shortened to just HTML5.
- CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1. It brings a lot of long awaited novelties, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi columns, flexible box or grid layouts.
- JavaScriptÂ® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, most known as the scripting language for Web pages, but used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
- Bootstrap was created by a designer and a developer at Twitter, Bootstrap has become one of the most popular front-end frameworks and open source projects in the world. Prior to being an open-sourced framework, Bootstrap was known as Twitter Blueprint. A few months into development, Twitter held its first Hack Week and the project exploded as developers of all skill levels jumped in without any external guidance. It served as the style guide for internal tools development at the company for over a year before its public release, and continues to do so today.
- Flat UI is a beautiful theme for Bootstrap. We have redesigned many of its components to look flat in every pixel. For the most part, it is very simple to use, however, to be able to make some form elements and others look exactly how we want, we ended up using some JS plugins, which means it takes a little bit more effort to integrate them into your project.
- Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for Windows and OS X.
